        <h2>Rizal Park</center><br><span> During Spanish rule, Rizal Park, formerly called Luneta, was important as a meeting place for Manila's elite and as a place where rebels were put to death. The execution of Jose Rizal in 1896 was a turning point in its history. In 1902, the architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham declared Luneta to be the center of the American government. His designs included notable buildings such as the Agricultural Building (now the National Museum of Natural History), Finance Building (now the National Museum of the Filipino People), and Senate Building (now the National Art Gallery).
  In 1913, the park was renamed Rizal Park in honor of Dr. Jose Rizal after a monument honoring him was built. It still serves as a symbol of bravery and independence, serving as a venue for political protests, national gatherings, and regular events like walks, concerts, jogging, and family picnics. The park endures despite people coming and departing, safeguarding monuments and memories that will guarantee Rizal Park's survival for generations to come.

        <h2>Anda Circle</center><br><span> The Anda Monument, an obelisk marking the border between Intramuros and Port Area in central Manila, Philippines, was first built in honor of Simón de Anda y Salazar. It acts as an interchange system connecting Bonifacio Drive, Mel Lopez Boulevard, Andres Soriano Avenue (formerly Calle Aduana), and Roberto Oca Street. It is frequently mistakenly called the Anda Circle after the nearby intersections.
The monument was built for the first time in 1871 close to the Pasig River as a way to publicly thank Anda for leading resistance against the British during Manila's occupation in 1762. Regretfully, Manila suffered severe damage during the Japanese occupation during World War II. After the war, the monument was redesigned as a monument circle and moved to its current location at the rotunda. In his speech on June 8, 1957, President Carlos P. Garcia honored Anda for his bravery and defense of the Filipino people against Spanish mistreatment.

        <h2>Manila City Hall</center><br><span> One of the most notable landmarks in Manila, the Philippine capital, is Manila City Hall. The building, which has a hexagonal tower with three red-faced clocks on three of its sides, was criticized in its early years for its lack of entrances, minimalist architectural style, and clock tower placement. The floor layout of the building has been written off as having a shape comparable to a coffin or, conversely, the Knights Templar shield.
For the same reasons that made the structure so condemned, many critics today admire the City Hall's design. The building is situated in the heart of a tourist region that is home to important government structures and famous sites. Situated just south of the city hall are the Department of Tourism, the Museum of the Filipino People, and the National Museum. Located south of the museums lies Rizal Park, the biggest urban park in the nation. Additionally, the walled city of Intramuros, the oldest and most historic area of Manila, is not far from the city hall.

The Rizal Shrine within the fort houses memorabilia of the hero, showcasing his final footsteps before execution. It is named after Saint James, the patron saint of Spain, the fort stands on the former site of a palisaded fort belonging to Muslim Tagalog Rajah Matanda. The original structure of Fort Santiago have faced destruction during Chinese pirate invasions, leading to its reconstruction with hard stone (Volcanic tuff) from 1590 to 1593. The completed fort featured a castellated design, including a gun platform named after Saint Barbara and curtain walls extending to face the city.

It was constructed in 1603 to prevent land invasions on the southeast side of the walled city and to guard the original Puerta Real, which is now the Gen. Luna Gap.
Baluarte de San Andres was refurbished in 1733, when a garita (sentry box or turret) and a bombproof powder magazine were added. Later, a dock was added to allow boats to pass through the moat. But it wasn't rebuilt until after the British occupation, having been destroyed during the invasion. The Intramuros Administration rebuilt it after it was devastated once more in 1945.

The fort's origins trace back to Governor General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, integrating an older fort with curtain walls in 1591-1594, featuring a bastion designed for enhanced artillery visibility.

First built in 1878 by the Society of Jesus and completed in 1889, the San Ignacio Church, according to contemporaries, was said to be one of the most beautiful in old Manila. Miller (1906), who called it the “jewel of Intramuros,” described its interior as “ravishingly beautiful,” Kemlein (1908) stated that “the charming splendor of this church will never fail to make the deepest impression upon the visitor,” while O’Reilly (1940) wrote that “nowhere in the Islands will more excellent wood carvings be found than here.” The church was the masterpiece of old Manila’s greatest artists. Don Felix Roxas, reputedly the most famous architect of the day, designed the structure, while grandmasters such as Isabelo Tampinco, Crispulo Hocson, Agustin Saez, and Manuel Flores (wood-works), Francisco Rodoreda (marble-works), and Hilario Sunico (metal-works) painstakingly decorated the interior and exterior of the building.
